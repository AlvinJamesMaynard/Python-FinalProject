Created/modified 5 images for testing in game. (My son was asking to make images for the game. So waiting for him to create some).
Decided to use pygame for the GUI in the game.
Got some basic coding done. (Long way to go).

WORKING ON.
1. Still need sounds.
2. A lot more code to add.
3. Get images from son and switch out with images I have.
4. Create a user manual.
5. Update GitHub.
